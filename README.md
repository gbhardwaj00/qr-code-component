## My process

I coded the HTML first and then went on to work with the CSS. While doing that, I had some problems like font-weight not working but kept finding solution. In that case, the container width didn't allow it to have the required size which I found out after. Solving problems like this is a great learning experience, google is your friend.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This is my first project since a long time as I step into this world of web development once again and I had to re-go into some important things like 'position', CSS Box Model to get things right. I learnt to work with classes when needed and use them only when needed.


### Continued development

I will keep working with CSS Box Model to better understand and place different containers acc. to what the page requires. I still have to learn about CSS Flex, CSS Grid etc. and that's the reasons for me only using basic CSS properties to place my elements on the page.
